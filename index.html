<h2>
Chapter 2: The Downfall
</h2> 

<p>
  <b>
Doom was imminent once Dean Dudley decided to go to Sylvester Middle School, a power plant for brainrot and crazy children. Dean engaged in conversations with like-minded folk such as Pheonix, Victor, and Greyson. This made him TOO comfortable with Skibidi Toilet. This led him into the world of... rule... thirty... four...

<h2>
Chapter 3: The 34th Law
</h2> 

<p>
  <b>
Though Dean Dudley wasn't a law abiding citizen, he was very interested in the 34th law of the internet. (Do your own research...) He began to find himself watching videos about the law in the bathroom, bedroom, living room, and even in the back of the classroom!

<h2>
Chapter 4: Male Attraction
</h2> 

<br>

<p>
  <b>
    While browsing the 34th law of the internet, Dean Dudley stumbled across content including femanine men. He felt an intriguing and arousing feeling build up in his big bingbonblongschlong. This was further strengthed when his boyfriend, Victor Veal, showed him femboy catboys with tentacles. Dean, along with Victor, began to read manga inculding femboys, catboys, and tentacles. (Octopus humans.)

<h2>
Chapter 5: Dopamine Chasing
</h2> 

<br>

<p>
  <b>
    Dean Dudley soon found that consuming this content wasn't enough. The dopamine hits were getting stale. He seeked something... stronger. This led to Dean dressing up as a Skibidi Toilet with tentacles, cat ears, and a tail. (Like his sister.) He procuded to engage in silly activities in this outfit.

<h2>
Chapter 6: Skibidi Ballin
</h2> 

<br>

<p>
  <b>
    Dean was down at Skibidi-Mart to grab a new pair of cat ears for Victor. (Valentines day!) As he scanned his card in the self checkout machine his eyes lit up in  horror when he saw the dreaded words. Card. Declined. With no other career in mind, Dean pursued the one career he was passionate in. OnlySkibidis. His first video was him trying the Grimace Shake in ohio while seductively wiggling his toes infront of the camera. Instant hit. His page propelled to 500,000 followers, and his bank propelled to a whopping $3.57. He was finally able to buy Victor his cat ears, though he did have to do the cashier a special "favor" to cover what he was short.
